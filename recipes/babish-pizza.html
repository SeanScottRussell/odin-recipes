        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Tin of tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Other ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>

        <li>Any toppings of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, 
            active dry yeast, and salt. Add the water and, 
            with a wooden spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen 
            towel and allow it to rise at room temperature 
            for 18 hours or until it has more than doubled. 
            It will take longer in a chilly room and less time 
            in a very warm one.</li><br>
        <li>Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. 
            Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them. 
            For each portion, start with the right side of the 
            dough and pull it towards the center; then do the 
            same with the left, then the top, then the bottom 
            (the order doesn’t actually matter; what you want is 
            four folds). Shape each portion into a round and turn 
            seam side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound. 
            The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.</li><br>
            <li>If you don’t intend to use the dough right away, wrap 
                the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for 
                up to 3 days. Return to room temperature by leaving 
                them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 
                2 to 3 hours before needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pizza Sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating olive oil in a pan over medium heat. 
            Then add some roughly cut garlic and saute for one minute. 
            Add some red pepper flakes and let those cook for about 10-15 seconds.</li><br>
        <li>Add a 28-ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Stir in and lightly 
            break up the tomatoes. Add some dry onion powder along with some dry oregano, 
            stir to combine and let simmer for 30-45 minutes. </li><br>
        <li>Add sauce to a blender and puree for about 10-15 seconds. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pizza Assembly:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slowly start to pat the dough down into the general shape of a pizza. 
            Don’t roll it out with a rolling pin. Once the dough had grown in size, 
            pass over your knuckles and slowly start to spread it out until a pizza
            pie shape is formed. </li><br>
        <li>Add your sauce and low moisture mozzarella along with whatever toppings 
            you’d like and place on your pizza stone in your preheated 500°F oven 
            (pre-heat for 1 hour). Bake for 7-9 minutes. </li><br>
        <li>Let cool for a few minutes. Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
